# Silky Spawners - Minecraft 1.12.2 Mod
This is a simple mod that allows you to break and collect Mob Spawners with any Pickaxe enchanted with Silk Touch.

This was an idea originally created by mushroomhostage & [xgh0stkillerx](https://dev.bukkit.org/members/xgh0stkillerx)  and their  [SilkSpawners plugin for Bukkit](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/silkspawners).

Why would I need this mod?

-   If you want to be able to collect Mob Spawners with Silk Touch pickaxes.
-   It is simple and adds a feature that should already be in Minecraft (but isn't).

## Frequently Asked Questions

- Yes! Of course! Just please leave me some credit in your description or permissions file :)
