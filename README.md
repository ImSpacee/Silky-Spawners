# Silky Spawners - A Minecraft 1.12.2 Mod
| NOW DEPRECATED/ABANDONED.

This is a simple mod that allows you to break and collect Mob Spawners with any Pickaxe enchanted with Silk Touch.
This was an idea originally created by mushroomhostage & [xgh0stkillerx](https://dev.bukkit.org/members/xgh0stkillerx) and their [SilkSpawners plugin for Bukkit](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/silkspawners).

## Why would I need this mod?
 - If you want to be able to collect Mob Spawners with Silk Touch pickaxes.
 - It is simple and adds a feature that should already be in Minecraft (but isn't).

## Frequently Asked Questions

"Can I use this mod in my modpack?"  
- Yes! Of course! Just please leave me some credit in your description or permissions file :)

## I need support/help! Please?

I do not offer support, I think this should be pretty obvious as to why.
